#This program takes a table of leaf or stem or stripe rust phenotype reading (seedling) and insert additional columns to it.
#This program is intended for technicians or rust researchers who have zero or little knowledge about perl or unix
#To use it, simply download this script to any linux system and type the command lines such as  "perl convert_rust_reading.field.pl --typo sr.typo.txt --pheno TCAP_seedling.txt --columns "

#This program requires two tab-delimited files (easily produced by copying from excel ...); 
#Attention: It cannot directly take excel files; you must save your data into one or multiple .txt files
#(1) A human typo file to convert typos to standardized readings; the typo file should have two columns; 
    # col1 is your original typos; col2 is the thing that you want it to be; 
#(2) The main phenotype file (need to tell the program which columns are your phenotype readings to be converted; 
    # Pay special attention that Perl is different than some other languages such as R; 
    # It counts from 0, so --columns 5,7 means that the phenotype readings are in columns 6,8;
